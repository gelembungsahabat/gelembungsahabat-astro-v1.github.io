Stack that I use:

- Astro with ReactJS (for ez routing and SEO)
- ReactJS with Typescript

To learn more about the folder structure of an Astro project, refer to [Astro's guide on project structure](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/).

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
